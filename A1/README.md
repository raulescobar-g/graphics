7 tasks completed.


notes:

The main.cpp contains a switch statement that calls a helper task function from utils.h depending on what task number was passed in.

 - Classes:
    
    - Image (given in starter code)

    - Triangle
        - Vertex
            - Position
            - Color
            - Normal vector 
        - BoundingBox

    - Zbuffer

On task 6 and 7, I am not sure if tri.obj came out correctly, but the bunny, teapot, and sphere are fine for both. I only ask the grader respectfully to be granted partial credit for implementing it to some degree.
