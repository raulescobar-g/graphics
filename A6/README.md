I used a thread safe queue created by Adam Kecskes     https://github.com/K-Adam/SafeQueue
    

- Implemented all tasks
    - camera can be moved in SceneManager.h on lines 390

- Multi-threaded for all scenes
    - thread count can be manipulated on line 51 of main.cpp, it is input of generate_scene

- Refraction on scene 9
